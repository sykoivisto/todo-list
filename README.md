# ToDo List

## [Live DEMO](https://sykoivisto.github.io/todo-list/)

## Description

I built this project to practice building JavaScript applications using ES6 Modules, Factory Functions, OOP Principles, localStorage, and Webpack.

This project includes objects that are dynamically created, and renders page content dynamically from these objects. A big part of this project was organizing the code efficiently, including using separate single-purpose modules and functions, as well as keeping application logic separated from the dom related stuff.
